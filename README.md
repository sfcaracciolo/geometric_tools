# geometric tools

Some basic geometric operations based on Open3D like:

* project_to_sphere: project a point cloud to a sphere based on center and radius parameters.
* project_to_surface: project a point cloud to a surface. The implementation use RaycastingScene (open3d).
* compute_inner_sphere: compute parameters of a sphere which is inner of a point cloud given.
* ...
